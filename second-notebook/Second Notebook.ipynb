    "# Modules in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A **module** in Python is a file containing Python code-such as functions, classes, variables, and runnable statements-that helps organize and reuse code efficiently. Modules allow you to break down large programs into smaller, manageable, and logical parts, making your code easier to maintain and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Python Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Organization:** Modules let you group related code (functions, classes, variables) together in a single file, typically with a `.py` extension.\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Once a module is created, you can import and use its contents in any other Python script, avoiding code duplication and promoting reuse.\n",
    "- **Namespace:** Each module has its own namespace, so the names defined in one module won’t conflict with names in another, reducing naming collisions.\n",
    "- **Standard and User-Defined:** Python comes with a rich standard library of modules (like `math`, `os`, `sys`), and you can also create your own custom modules.\n",
    "- **Importing:** To use a module, you import it into your script using the `import` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** Breaks complex problems into smaller, focused files.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Easier to update or fix code in one place without affecting the entire project.\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Share and reuse code across multiple projects or with other developers.\n",
