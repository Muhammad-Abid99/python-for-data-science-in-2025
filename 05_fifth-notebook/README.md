# README for Fifth_Notebook.ipynb

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to **tuples** in Python, covering their definition, properties, creation, common operations, immutability, deletion strategies, and usage of the `zip()` function with tuples. It is designed for learners who want to understand both the theoretical concepts and practical applications of tuples in Python programming.

### What is a Tuple?

A **tuple** is a built-in Python data structure that stores multiple items in a single variable. Unlike lists, tuples are **immutable**â€”their contents cannot be changed after creation. They are defined using parentheses `()` and can contain elements of any data type, including other tuples.

### Key Properties

- **Ordered**: Elements have a fixed order and are accessible by index.
- **Immutable**: Cannot modify, add, or remove elements after creation.
- **Allows Duplicates**: Elements can repeat.
- **Supports Multiple Data Types**: Can store mixed data types.
- **Defined with Parentheses**: Example: `(1, "apple", True)`.

### Common Tuple Operations

- **Accessing Elements**: Using indices and slicing.
- **Concatenation**: Combine tuples with `+`.
- **Repetition**: Repeat tuples with `*`.
- **Membership Test**: Use `in` to check for existence.
- **Length**: Use `len()` to get the number of elements.
- **Unpacking**: Assign tuple elements to variables.
- **Slicing**: Extract sub-tuples.
