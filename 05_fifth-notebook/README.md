# README for Fifth_Notebook.ipynb

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to **tuples** in Python, covering their definition, properties, creation, common operations, immutability, deletion strategies, and usage of the `zip()` function with tuples. It is designed for learners who want to understand both the theoretical concepts and practical applications of tuples in Python programming.

### What is a Tuple?

A **tuple** is a built-in Python data structure that stores multiple items in a single variable. Unlike lists, tuples are **immutable**â€”their contents cannot be changed after creation. They are defined using parentheses `()` and can contain elements of any data type, including other tuples.
