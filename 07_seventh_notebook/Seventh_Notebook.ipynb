    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures code by bundling data and the functions that operate on that data into single units called *objects*. In Python, OOP is widely used to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code, especially as applications grow in complexity.\n"

    "**Class and Object**\n",
    "- *Class*: A blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n",
    "- *Object*: An instance of a class, with its own unique data but sharing the class's methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation**\n",
    "- Bundles data (attributes) and methods into a single unit (class), restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
    "- Example: A `BankAccount` class hides the account balance and exposes only deposit/withdraw methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance**\n",
    "- Allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse.\n",
    "- Example: A `Car` class can inherit from a `Vehicle` class, reusing and extending its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism**\n",
    "- Enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, allowing the same method to behave differently depending on the object.\n",
    "- Example: Both `Dog` and `Cat` classes have a `speak()` method, but each implements it differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction**\n",
    "- Hides complex implementation details and exposes only the necessary parts of an object.\n",
    "- Example: A `Database` class exposes a `connect()` method, hiding the underlying connection logic.\n",

    "### Why Use OOP in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Code is organized into logical, self-contained units, making large projects easier to manage.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Classes can be reused across different projects, reducing duplication and speeding up development.\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Encapsulation and modularity make it easier to update, debug, and extend code without affecting unrelated parts.\n",
    "- **Real-World Modeling**: OOP naturally maps to real-world entities, making code more intuitive and easier to understand for complex systems.\n",
    "- **Data Science Applications**: OOP helps data scientists build reusable data processing pipelines, custom data structures, and scalable machine learning workflows.\n"
