    "**Program Description: Manual String Length Calculation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python program demonstrates a fundamental approach to determining the length of a string without utilizing built-in functions such as `len()`. It prompts the user to input a string and then iteratively counts the number of characters in the string by traversing each character one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input:**  \n",
    "   The program begins by requesting the user to enter a string via the `input()` function, which captures the input as a sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization of Counter:**  \n",
    "   A variable named `counter` is initialized to zero. This variable serves as an accumulator to keep track of the number of characters encountered during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative Counting:**  \n",
    "   The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the input string. For every iteration (i.e., for each character), the counter is incremented by one. This process effectively counts all characters, including letters, digits, spaces, and special symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:**  \n",
    "   After the loop completes, the program prints the total count, which represents the length of the string entered by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance and Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Educational Value:**  \n",
    "  This program is an excellent exercise for beginners to understand string traversal, iteration, and manual counting mechanisms in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic Insight:**  \n",
    "  It provides insight into how string length can be computed at a low level, which is foundational knowledge for understanding more complex string operations and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoiding Built-ins:**  \n",
    "  In scenarios where built-in functions are restricted or unavailable, this method offers a reliable alternative to determine string length."

    "\n",
    "4. **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":` Guard:**  \n",
    "   This allows the script to be imported as a module without executing the input/output code, which is a good practice for writing Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Formatted String (f-string):**  \n",
    "   Using f-strings for output improves readability and efficiency compared to string concatenation."

    "**Extracting the Username from an Email Address Using `.index()` and `.find()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python program demonstrates two distinct approaches to extracting the username portion of an email address (the substring before the `@` symbol) using the string methods `.index()` and `.find()`. The username is the unique identifier before the domain in an email address (e.g., in `ghulam34muhammad@gmail.com`, the username is `ghulam34muhammad`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Using `.index()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Input:**  \n",
    "  The program prompts the user to enter an email address.\n",
    "- **Finding the `@` Symbol:**  \n",
    "  The `.index('@')` method is used to determine the position (index) of the `@` character in the email string. This method raises a `ValueError` if the character is not found, which can be useful for enforcing valid email input.\n",
    "- **Extracting the Username:**  \n",
    "  The program slices the string from the beginning up to (but not including) the `@` symbol using `mail[0:possition]`.\n",
    "- **Output:**  \n",
    "  The username is printed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Using `.find()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Input:**  \n",
    "  The program again prompts the user to enter an email address.\n",
    "- **Finding the `@` Symbol:**  \n",
    "  The `.find('@')` method is used to locate the position of the `@` character. Unlike `.index()`, `.find()` returns `-1` if the character is not found, allowing for more graceful error handling.\n",
    "- **Extracting the Username:**  \n",
    "  The substring before the `@` symbol is extracted in the same way as before.\n",
    "- **Output:**  \n",
    "  The username is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts and Expertise Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String Manipulation:**  \n",
    "  The program showcases fundamental string slicing techniques to extract substrings based on character positions.\n",
    "- **Method Differences:**  \n",
    "  By using both `.index()` and `.find()`, the program illustrates the subtle but important differences between these methods:\n",
    "  - `.index()` is strict and will raise an error if the character is not found.\n",
    "  - `.find()` is more forgiving and returns `-1`, allowing for custom error handling.\n",
    "- **Input Validation (Potential Extension):**  \n",
    "  While the current program does not handle invalid input, it sets the stage for discussing robust input validation, which is crucial in production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Data Processing:**  \n",
    "  Extracting usernames from email addresses is a common requirement in user registration systems, authentication workflows, and data analytics.\n",
    "- **Error Handling Awareness:**  \n",
    "  Understanding the difference between `.index()` and `.find()` is essential for writing robust and user-friendly applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:**  \n",
    "This program provides a clear, practical demonstration of extracting the username from an email address using two different string search methods, highlighting their behaviors and potential use cases. It’s a valuable exercise for understanding string operations and method selection in Python."

    "## Improvements Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Function Encapsulation**\n",
    "- The core logic is encapsulated in a reusable function `count_character_frequency`, which promotes modularity, easier testing, and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Input Validation**\n",
    "- The function validates that the search character is exactly one character long, preventing unexpected behavior or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Case Sensitivity Option**\n",
    "- Added a `case_sensitive` parameter to allow counting characters either case-sensitively or insensitively.\n",
    "- The example usage in `main()` uses case-insensitive counting by converting both the string and character to lowercase before counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Use of Built-in String Method**\n",
    "- Instead of manually iterating over the string, the function leverages Python’s efficient built-in `str.count()` method, which is optimized and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **User Input Sanitization**\n",
    "- The inputs are stripped of leading and trailing whitespace to avoid counting errors caused by accidental spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Error Handling**\n",
    "- The program uses a `try-except` block to catch and report input validation errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Script Entry Point**\n",
    "- The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard allows the script to be imported as a module without executing the main routine, adhering to Python best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Version Is Advanced\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness:** Handles invalid inputs and provides meaningful error messages.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Supports case-sensitive and case-insensitive counting.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Uses Python’s optimized built-in methods rather than manual loops.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns with well-documented functions.\n",
    "- **User Experience:** Clean input handling and informative output.\n"

    "\n",
    "The program is designed to **remove all occurrences of a user-specified character from a given string**. It takes two inputs from the user: the original string and the character to be removed. The output is the modified string with all instances of that character eliminated.\n",

    "### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n",

    "string = input('Enter the string')\n",
    "character = input('What would you like to remove')\n",

    "    if i != character:\n",

    "- **Initialization:** An empty string `result` is used to accumulate the filtered characters.\n",
    "- **Iteration:** The program iterates over each character `i` in the original string.\n",
    "- **Condition:** If `i` is **not** equal to the character to be removed, it is concatenated to `result`.\n",
    "    - This effectively skips all instances of the specified character.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Output**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('After remove particular character your output is -->', result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The final, filtered string is displayed to the user.\n",

    "- We keep only alphanumeric characters (`ch.isalnum()`), making the check more flexible and realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Case Insensitivity\n",
    "- Convert all characters to lowercase to treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Two-Pointer Technique\n",
    "- Instead of reversing the string or using extra memory, two pointers check characters from both ends moving inward.\n",
    "- This approach is efficient (O(n) time, O(1) space).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Edge Cases\n",
    "- Empty strings or strings with one character are trivially palindromes.\n",
    "- The program handles these gracefully without unnecessary computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Modular Design\n",
    "- Separation of concerns: normalization and palindrome checking are distinct functions.\n",
    "- This makes the code easier to maintain, test, and extend.\n",
    "\n",

    "This Python program implements a custom algorithm to count the number of words in a user-provided string **without using the built-in `split()` function**. Instead, it manually parses the string character by character, identifying word boundaries based on spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Acquisition**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   s = input('Enter the string')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The program prompts the user to enter a string, which is stored in variable `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   L = []\n",
    "   temp = ''\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `L` is an empty list that will store the extracted words.\n",
    "   - `temp` is a temporary string used to accumulate characters of the current word.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manual Parsing Loop**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in s:\n",
    "       if i != ' ':\n",
    "           temp = temp + i\n",
    "       else:\n",
    "           L.append(temp)\n",
    "           temp = ''\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The loop iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.\n",
    "   - If the character is **not** a space, it is appended to `temp`, thus building a word.\n",
    "   - If a space is encountered, the current word stored in `temp` is appended to list `L`, and `temp` is reset to an empty string to start collecting the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling the Last Word**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   L.append(temp) # To print last word also\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - After the loop, `temp` may still contain the last word (since the string might not end with a space). This line ensures the last word is added to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(L)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The list `L`, now containing all the words from the input string, is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Use of `split()`**: The code demonstrates how to tokenize a string into words without using the convenience of Python's `split()` method, showcasing a fundamental approach to string parsing.\n",
    "- **Handles Single Spaces**: The code assumes words are separated by single spaces. Multiple consecutive spaces or leading/trailing spaces will result in empty strings being added to `L`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the string: Hello world from Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "['Hello', 'world', 'from', 'Python']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is a classic example of low-level string parsing, demonstrating how to manually extract words from a string in Python. It is useful for understanding the mechanics of string manipulation and tokenization when built-in utilities are not permitted.\n"

    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regular Expression Tokenization**: The regex pattern `\\b\\w+\\b` matches word boundaries (`\\b`) around one or more word characters (`\\w+`), which include letters, digits, and underscores. This effectively extracts words while ignoring punctuation and multiple whitespace characters[1][6].\n",

    "- **Robustness**: Unlike the original program, this method handles multiple consecutive spaces, tabs, and newlines seamlessly, without generating empty tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: The regex pattern can be easily modified to include or exclude specific characters, or to handle more complex tokenization rules such as contractions, hyphenated words, or special tokens used in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this Advanced?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It avoids manual character-by-character parsing, which is error-prone and less efficient.\n",
    "- It leverages Python’s powerful `re` module to perform pattern matching, a common practice in professional text processing.\n",
    "- It produces a clean list of tokens without empty strings or unwanted characters.\n",
    "- The approach is scalable and adaptable for natural language processing tasks beyond simple word counting.\n",
