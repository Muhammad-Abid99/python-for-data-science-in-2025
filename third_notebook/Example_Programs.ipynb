    "**Program Description: Manual String Length Calculation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python program demonstrates a fundamental approach to determining the length of a string without utilizing built-in functions such as `len()`. It prompts the user to input a string and then iteratively counts the number of characters in the string by traversing each character one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input:**  \n",
    "   The program begins by requesting the user to enter a string via the `input()` function, which captures the input as a sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization of Counter:**  \n",
    "   A variable named `counter` is initialized to zero. This variable serves as an accumulator to keep track of the number of characters encountered during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterative Counting:**  \n",
    "   The program uses a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the input string. For every iteration (i.e., for each character), the counter is incremented by one. This process effectively counts all characters, including letters, digits, spaces, and special symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:**  \n",
    "   After the loop completes, the program prints the total count, which represents the length of the string entered by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance and Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Educational Value:**  \n",
    "  This program is an excellent exercise for beginners to understand string traversal, iteration, and manual counting mechanisms in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic Insight:**  \n",
    "  It provides insight into how string length can be computed at a low level, which is foundational knowledge for understanding more complex string operations and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoiding Built-ins:**  \n",
    "  In scenarios where built-in functions are restricted or unavailable, this method offers a reliable alternative to determine string length."

    "## Program Description: Extracting the Username from an Email Address Using `.index()` and `.find()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python program demonstrates two distinct approaches to extracting the username portion of an email address (the substring before the `@` symbol) using the string methods `.index()` and `.find()`. The username is the unique identifier before the domain in an email address (e.g., in `ghulam34muhammad@gmail.com`, the username is `ghulam34muhammad`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Using `.index()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Input:**  \n",
    "  The program prompts the user to enter an email address.\n",
    "- **Finding the `@` Symbol:**  \n",
    "  The `.index('@')` method is used to determine the position (index) of the `@` character in the email string. This method raises a `ValueError` if the character is not found, which can be useful for enforcing valid email input.\n",
    "- **Extracting the Username:**  \n",
    "  The program slices the string from the beginning up to (but not including) the `@` symbol using `mail[0:possition]`.\n",
    "- **Output:**  \n",
    "  The username is printed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Using `.find()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Input:**  \n",
    "  The program again prompts the user to enter an email address.\n",
    "- **Finding the `@` Symbol:**  \n",
    "  The `.find('@')` method is used to locate the position of the `@` character. Unlike `.index()`, `.find()` returns `-1` if the character is not found, allowing for more graceful error handling.\n",
    "- **Extracting the Username:**  \n",
    "  The substring before the `@` symbol is extracted in the same way as before.\n",
    "- **Output:**  \n",
    "  The username is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts and Expertise Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String Manipulation:**  \n",
    "  The program showcases fundamental string slicing techniques to extract substrings based on character positions.\n",
    "- **Method Differences:**  \n",
    "  By using both `.index()` and `.find()`, the program illustrates the subtle but important differences between these methods:\n",
    "  - `.index()` is strict and will raise an error if the character is not found.\n",
    "  - `.find()` is more forgiving and returns `-1`, allowing for custom error handling.\n",
    "- **Input Validation (Potential Extension):**  \n",
    "  While the current program does not handle invalid input, it sets the stage for discussing robust input validation, which is crucial in production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Data Processing:**  \n",
    "  Extracting usernames from email addresses is a common requirement in user registration systems, authentication workflows, and data analytics.\n",
    "- **Error Handling Awareness:**  \n",
    "  Understanding the difference between `.index()` and `.find()` is essential for writing robust and user-friendly applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:**  \n",
    "This program provides a clear, practical demonstration of extracting the username from an email address using two different string search methods, highlighting their behaviors and potential use cases. It’s a valuable exercise for understanding string operations and method selection in Python."
